# Modules and pip.
# Module is a pre-written code library which we can use in our code. there are two types of modules:
# 1. Built in modules- this modules are pre-installed along with the python and we can use it directly 
#                      eg: hashlib
# 2. External modules- this are third party modules and needed to be installed before use.
#                      once installed in a system can be used anytime.
#                      installed using pip install modulename.
#                      eg: pandas, sklearn.
